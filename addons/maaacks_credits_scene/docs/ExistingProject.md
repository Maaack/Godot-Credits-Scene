# Existing Project

To revisit any part of the initial setup, find the `Setup Wizard` at `Project > Tools > Run Maaack's Credits Scene Setup...`. Example files can be re-copied from the `Setup Wizard`, assuming they have not been deleted.

Update the game credits / attribution.

1.  Update the example `ATTRIBUTION.md` with the project's credits.
2.  Open `scrollable_credits.tscn` and  `scrolling_credits.tscn`.
3.  Check the `CreditsLabel` has updated with the text.
4.  Optionally, change settings or disable `Auto Update`.
5.  Save both scenes (even they show no changes).
