# Godot Credits Scene
For Godot 4.2

This credits scene scrolls text that is read from an attribution file in a markdown (`.md`) format.

[Example on itch.io](https://maaack.itch.io/godot-game-template)  
_Example is of [Maaack's Game Template](https://github.com/Maaack/Godot-Game-Template), which includes additional features._

### GitHub

5.  Enable the plugin from the Project Settings > Plugins tab.  
    If it's enabled for the first time,

#### Extras

Users that want additional features can try [Maaack's Game Template](https://github.com/Maaack/Godot-Game-Template).  

## Usage

Changes can be made directly to scenes and scripts outside of `addons/`. 

A copy of the `examples/` directory is made outside of `addons/` when the plugin is enabled for the first time. However, if this is skipped, it is recommended developers inherit from scenes they want to use, and save the inherited scene outside of `addons/`. This avoids changes getting lost either from the package updating, or because of a `.gitignore`.
